# 🌬️ Mini Wind Tunnel Project (Mark I)  
**Objective:**  
Build a low-cost wind tunnel from recycled materials to visualise airflow over small-scale F1 models, with the long-term goal of developing affordable test rigs for student aero projects.

---

## 🛠️ Build Overview  
- Constructed using recycled materials (cardboard, plastic bottles, pringles can).  
- Used matches and incense to create smoke for flow visualisation.  
- Tested with a small F1 model car.  

📂 See [`/Build`](./Build) for photos + notes.  

---

## 🔬 Tests & Results  
- Smoke visualisation over F1 model car ✅  
- Non-uniform flow ❌ (turbulent regions, inconsistent velocity).  
- Managed to get **some successful visuals** despite setup limitations.  

📂 See [`/Test`](./Test) for test photos & observations.

## 📊 Lessons Learned  
- Flow straighteners (honeycomb/mesh) needed for uniform airflow.  
- Fan power had a major effect on turbulence.  
- Scaling is difficult without a proper contraction section.  
- Next version (MkII) will need better design of inlet → test section → diffuser.  

---

## 🚦 Next Steps   
- Add a secure honeycomb mesh for straighter flow.  
- Use a ducted design and better proportions.
- Upgrade to 3D-printed parts for structure.
