We made it! The testing stage, this was pretty exciting to me, since I never actually make it this far. 
Without further ado, lets experiment. 

Burned 3 matches and an incense stick, then put them in the foil area.
Closing the flap of cardboard allowed more smoke to stay inside the system, so I could have more visuals on the flow.

Then, I used a hairdryer as a source of wind, The hairdryer I used says 2200 W on the side, but that number is almost all about heat and has very little to do with airflow. 
To get a rough idea of how fast the air actually moves, I took the usual flow rate for a standard dryer, about one to two cubic metres a minute, and then ran it through the classic ùë£=ùëÑ/ùê¥ 
With the outlet being about the size of a small drinks can, the numbers land somewhere in the range of ten to twenty five metres per second.

Now for my wind tunnel, which is extremely small, this speed was way too much, and you will understand why when you watch the video.

The videos above are tests that I ran with the setup, there were more videos, but no visual of the flow. 
Had to take a couple of minutes to let the smoke build up before turning on the fan, but even then, the flow only lasts half a second due to the lack of smoke generation. 

Hall of fame:
Below are some of my favourite images from the testing, some of which I thought were beautiful enough to stare at for a bit haha.
